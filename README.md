# Text Analyzer

A small Python command-line project that analyzes text files and reports simple statistics.

This repository contains:

- `main.py` - the project's entrypoint (expects a text file to analyze).
- `text.txt` - example or sample input file.

Features

- Counts words, lines, and characters.
- Simple, easy-to-run script suitable for demos and portfolio.

Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (3.10 recommended)

Quick start

1. Open a terminal in the project root (Windows PowerShell, CMD, or Bash).

2. Run the analyzer using the included `text.txt` sample:

```bash
python main.py text.txt
```

3. To analyze a different file, replace `text.txt` with your file path.

Notes

- If your Python executable is `python3`, use `python3 main.py text.txt`.
- The script prints analysis results to stdout.
